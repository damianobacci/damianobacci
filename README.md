### Hi there!

I am a software developer and data journalist experimenting with a bunch of things, trying to get a grasp on the world of computer science. Here you can find experiments, under development and completed projects.

I am also studying the [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) curriculum, re-learning high school and college math in the process. 

Make sure to check my [portfolio](https://damianobacci.net/).
