### Hi there!

I am a software developer experimenting with a bunch of things, trying to get a grasp on the world of computer science. here you can find experiments, under development and completed projects.

I am also studying the [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) curriculum, re-learning high school math in the process. 

Make sure to check my [portfolio](https://damianobacci.net/).
